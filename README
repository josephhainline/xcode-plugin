Xcode plugin
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This fork is specifically to support a bug where you cannot embed a
      provisioning profile in your .IPA file because the plugin doesn't pass 
      the signing certificate.  
      See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14028 
      This adds a field for the signing certificate (the --sign param) and 
      allows you to bundle a provisioning profile in your .IPA. This is useful
      for distribution builds within your enterprise, without the iOS devices
      needing to be 'developer' devices.

Quick installation guide:
 1. Clone this repo to your machine
 2. Go to that directory, then type:
     mvn install
 3. To run stand alone version of Jenkins with this plugin, type:
     mvn hpi:run
 4. Or, to install this plugin, go to Manage Jenkins, Manage Plugins, 
    Advanced, Upload from File, then Choose file, and find the .HPI file.  
 5. Restart Jenkins. When it restarts, you should see the version of 
    xcode-plugin that says something like '1.3.2-SNAPSHOT (private-...)'.  
    This means it installed correctly.  

After successful installation:
   In your Xcode Build you should now have a "Code Signing Identity" field 
   right above the "Embedded Profile" field.

   Put the name of your identity in the "Code Signing Identity" field
     iPhone Distribution: My Corporation

   Put the full path to your provisioning profile associated with that 
   identity in the "Embedded Profile" field:
     /Users/myusername/workspace/ProvProfiles/ABC5F123-etc.mobileprovision 
   NOTE: Copy your profile to some path without spaces in the name. 
         By default it will be in a path with spaces, and I haven't been 
         able to get that to work, even when escaping the spaces.

This plugin adds the ability to call Xcode command line tools to automate build and packaging iOS applications (iPhone, iPad, ...).
